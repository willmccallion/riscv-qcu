//! Real-time visualization of qubit fidelity and error correction cycles.
//!
//! This module provides visualization capabilities for monitoring quantum
//! error correction operations, including qubit state displays, fidelity
//! graphs, and error correction cycle tracking. Currently a placeholder
//! for future visualization features.
